I am an Assistant Professor in Public Policy at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. From 2024 to 2027, I am also on the committee co-directing the PhD in Public Policy Programme at the LKY School.

My [research](/research) explores how stakeholders from the private and nonprofit sectors work with the government to collectively address policy challenges within the realm of environment and sustainability. My work encompasses several interdisciplinary domains, including public policy and administration, non-state and subnational environmental action, as well as performance evaluation and management.

My work has appeared in The [American Review of Public Administration](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/arp), [Global Environmental Change](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/global-environmental-change), and [Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/environmental-innovation-and-societal-transitions), among others. I have also been awarded the Emerging Scholar Scholarship at the [Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action (ARNOVA)](https://www.arnova.org/) as well as the Equity and Inclusion Fellowship at the [Association for Public Policy Analysis & Management (APPAM)](https://www.appam.org/). From 2024 to 2026, I am the Chair of the Public Policy, Politics and Law section of ARNOVA. I am also a member of the academic advisory board of [C40](https://www.c40.org/)â€™s [Centre for City Climate Policy and Economy](https://www.c40.org/what-we-do/raising-climate-ambition/centre-for-city-climate-policy-economy/#:~:text=The%20C40%20Centre%20for%20City,progressive%20and%20equitable%20climate%20action.) and a research affiliate with the [Institute for Environment and Sustainability (ies)](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/ies) and [Sustainable and Green Finance Institute (SGFIN)](https://sgfin.nus.edu.sg) at NUS.  

Alongside my research, I teach [courses](/teaching) on topics such as public policy, environment and sustainability, and R programming and data analytics. I also collect [data](/data) on voluntary environmental actions in Southeast Asia and other topics. Outside work, I enjoy food and playing sports with my friends and colleagues. I also take pride in organizing Team LKYSPP's participation in the [Annual Race Against Cancer](https://www.raceagainstcancer.org.sg/).
